# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-09-30

- Fix: Show Sell column to Sales and SalesManager roles using `hideSellFor` permission helper (UI tables: Inquiry Cart and Inquiry Edit now pass `hideSell` to `RateTable`).
- Chore(scripts): Make screenshots reliable â€” add `scripts/screenshot.cjs` using Puppeteer, support BASE_URL and small sleep helper to ensure pages finish rendering before capture.
- Docs: Updated `README.md` and `USER_MANUAL.md` with quick verification steps and references to newly captured screenshots under `public/manual/assets/`.

### Notes on CI (Azure/Oryx)

Azure's Oryx builder may fail when installing certain Puppeteer versions (ETARGET/No matching version). For CI deployments consider:

- Pinning a Puppeteer version available to Oryx (or matching project's Node version).
- Moving Puppeteer into a separate dev-only step used only for local/manual screenshots, not required by the build pipeline.
- Using headless-rendering services or GitHub Actions with setup-chrome instead of bundling Puppeteer in app dependencies.
